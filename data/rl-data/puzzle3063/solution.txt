Difficulty: hard (0 1x1 blockers, 4 2x1 blockers)
Coordinate system: [row,col] where [1,1] is top-left

SOLUTION:
========================================
Step 1: H2 [(4, 2), (4, 3)] -> [(4, 1), (4, 2)]
Step 2: H3 [(3, 2), (3, 3)] -> [(3, 1), (3, 2)]
Step 3: H1 [(1, 3), (2, 3)] -> [(2, 3), (3, 3)]
Step 4: H1 [(2, 3), (3, 3)] -> [(3, 3), (4, 3)]
Step 5: C [2,2] -> [2,3]
Step 6: C [2,3] -> [2,4]
