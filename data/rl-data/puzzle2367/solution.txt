Coordinate system: [row,col] where [1,1] is top-left

SOLUTION:
========================================
Step 1: H2 [(2, 3), (3, 3)] -> [(3, 3), (4, 3)]
Step 2: H3 [(2, 1), (2, 2)] -> [(1, 1), (1, 2)]
Step 3: C [4,1] -> [3,1]
Step 4: C [3,1] -> [2,1]
Step 5: C [2,1] -> [2,2]
Step 6: C [2,2] -> [2,3]
Step 7: C [2,3] -> [2,4]
