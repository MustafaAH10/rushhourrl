Coordinate system: [row,col] where [1,1] is top-left

SOLUTION:
========================================
Step 1: C [4,2] -> [4,3]
Step 2: H3 [(3, 1), (3, 2)] -> [(4, 1), (4, 2)]
Step 3: H2 [(3, 3), (3, 4)] -> [(3, 2), (3, 3)]
Step 4: C [4,3] -> [4,4]
Step 5: C [4,4] -> [3,4]
Step 6: B2 [2,4] -> [1,4]
Step 7: C [3,4] -> [2,4]
