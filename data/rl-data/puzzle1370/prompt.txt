You are an expert puzzle solver specializing in Rush Hour puzzles. Your task is to find the optimal sequence of moves to move the car 'C' to the TARGET position.

Key Instructions:
1. A 1-indexed coordinate system is being used
2. Each piece (car or blocker) can only move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT by exactly one square
3. For 1x1 pieces (car C and blockers B1, B2, etc.): Use single coordinate format
4. For 2x1 pieces (blockers H1, H2, etc.): Use double coordinate format with both occupied positions
5. Pieces CANNOT move outside the 4x4 grid or into occupied squares at any instant
6. Provide your solution in the exact format requested

Be precise with coordinates and piece movements. Think logically about the sequence of moves needed.

Task: Solve this 4x4 Rush Hour puzzle - move car "C" from position [4,4] to the TARGET at position [2,4] given the position of the blockers below.

Current Grid State (JSON format):
[["B1",".",".","."],[".","H1","H1","."],["H2",".",".","."],["H2",".",".","C"]]

Current Pieces:
- Car "C": Position [4,4]
- 1x1 Blockers (B1, B2, etc.): Single-cell obstacles that can be moved to clear a path
  - B1 at [1,1]
- 2x1 Blockers (H1, H2, etc.): Two-cell obstacles that move as a single unit
  - H1 (blocker) at (2,2), (2,3)
  - H2 (blocker) at (3,1), (4,1)
- TARGET: Position [2,4]

Movement Rules:
- Any piece (car "C", 1x1 blockers "B1, B2, etc.", or 2x1 blockers "H1, H2, etc.") can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
- Each move is exactly ONE square in any direction for the entire piece
- For 2x1 blockers: The entire piece moves together as a unit (both cells move simultaneously)
- Pieces strictly CANNOT move outside the 4x4 grid
- Pieces strictly CANNOT move into occupied squares (i.e. squares that already have another piece)
- At ANY instant, there CANNOT be two pieces occupying the same square
- The same piece can move multiple times in a row if needed
- You win when car "C" reaches the TARGET cell

Coordinate System:
- Use [row,col] format where [1,1] is top-left, [4,4] is bottom-right
- Each cell shows its coordinates in black text: (row,col)
- For 2x1 blockers, both occupied cells are shown in the piece description

Expected Output Format:
Wrap your solution in <solution> tags and provide it as a numbered list of moves in this exact format:

<solution>
Step 1: [PIECE] [start_position] -> [end_position]
Step 2: [PIECE] [start_position] -> [end_position]
...
</solution>

For 1x1 pieces (car "C" and blockers "B1", "B2", etc.):
- Use single coordinate: C [2,1] -> [2,2]

For 2x1 pieces (blockers "H1", "H2", etc.):
- List both coordinates: H1 [[1,1],[1,2]] -> [[2,1],[2,2]]

Example response format:
<solution>
Step 1: B2 [3,2] -> [4,2]
Step 2: H1 [(2,3), (3,3)] -> [(1,3), (2,3)]
Step 3: B2 [2,4] -> [1,4]
Step 4: C [3,1] -> [3,2]
Step 5: C [3,2] -> [3,3]
Step 6: C [3,3] -> [3,4]
Step 7: C [3,4] -> [2,4]
</solution>
